- Use dictionary to implement stages in conversation (welcome -> interested -> notify[/ already open class/ nonexistent class]-> interested if n < 2 / (welcomeback if checks are deleted -> welcome if refresh)/ (open class -> welcomeback if notify is done)
- Limit to 2 class check
- Utilize Subprocess
- Delete class checks (stop messages)
- Checker posts back to main app if open class so user can turn it off
- Server_name for flask to pass in to checker to let it know open class
